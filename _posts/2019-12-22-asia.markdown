Here's an overview of the Asian leg of our trip:
* 1 night in Shanghai, China
* 3 nights in Taipei, Taiwan
* 3 nights in Ubud, Bali
* 1 night in Labuan Bajo, Indonesia
* 4 nights on Dragon Dive LB Yoshi in Komodo National Park
* 4 nights in Bali (2 in Jimbaran and 2 in Seminyak)
* 4 nights in Singapore

On our way to Singapore, we experienced the worst delay of our trip of ~ 4 hours, which is pretty remarkable for such a long trip. We also had a pretty hard time even paying for a car to our hotel. Our normal trick of using ATMs to withdraw foreign currency failed over four different ATM cards and we were still unable to load money using WeChat Pay or Alipay (new international "launches" notwithstanding...), so we bit the bullet and paid the ~30% spread at the airport money exchangers.

Anyhow, we were upgraded to the biggest suite on the floor, with an incredible view! We had a lovely morning exploring The Bund, getting Shanghainese soup dumplings (xiaolongbao), salted cheese tea (which we pleasantly discovered on last year's trip to China), and a curry lunch.

Our first night in Taipei, I met up with DK and his friends, who were finishing their leg of the trip. Kelly stayed in the hotel to rest, as she had come down with a bit of a cold (all over the course of one week, we went from being 7 hours ahead to home time to eight hours behind).

We wanted to play it safe and take advantage of the medical care in Taiwan, so we made a quick trip to the doctor the next morning. On the way home, we picked up dragon fruit, passionfruit, sugar-apples, and more to feast in the hotel room!

Often known as the Tsukiji of Taipei, we loved [Addiction Aquatic](https://www.eater.com/2019/3/6/18242215/addiction-aquatic-best-taipei-seafood-fish-market), and feasted on a selection of raw and cooked seafood.

Kelly had her first massage (of many inexpensive and high-quality to come), and we were off to our first night market at [Ningxia](https://danielfooddiary.com/2017/02/16/ningxia/). We ate the usual suspects: stinky tofu, deep fried taro balls with salted egg yolk at Liu Yu Zai (劉芋仔), Fang Chia Shredded Chicken (方家雞肉飯), spring rolls (古早味潤餅), and topped it all off with some sesame peanut mochi shave ice (芝麻花生麻糬冰) and some durian for the walk home.
