Here's an overview of the Asian leg of our trip:
* 1 night in Shanghai, China
* 3 nights in Taipei, Taiwan
* 3 nights in Ubud, Bali
* 1 night in Labuan Bajo, Indonesia
* 4 nights on Dragon Dive LB Yoshi in Komodo National Park
* 4 nights in Bali (2 in Jimbaran and 2 in Seminyak)
* 4 nights in Singapore

On our way to Singapore, we experienced the worst delay of our trip of ~ 4 hours, which is pretty remarkable for such a long trip. We also had a pretty hard time even paying for a car to our hotel. Our normal trick of using ATMs to withdraw foreign currency failed over four different ATM cards and we were still unable to load money using WeChat Pay or Alipay (new international "launches" notwithstanding...), so we bit the bullet and paid the ~30% spread at the airport money exchangers.

Anyhow, we were upgraded to the biggest suite on the floor, with an incredible view! We had a lovely morning exploring The Bund, getting Shanghainese soup dumplings (xiaolongbao), salted cheese tea (which we pleasantly discovered on last year's trip to China), and a curry lunch.

Our first night in Taipei, I met up with DK and his friends, who were finishing their leg of the trip. Kelly stayed in the hotel to rest, as she had come down with a bit of a cold (all over the course of one week, we went from being 7 hours ahead to home time to eight hours behind).

We wanted to play it safe and take advantage of the medical care in Taiwan, so we made a quick trip to the doctor the next morning. On the way home, we picked up dragon fruit, passionfruit, sugar-apples, and more to feast in the hotel room!

Often known as the Tsukiji of Taipei, we loved [Addiction Aquatic](https://www.eater.com/2019/3/6/18242215/addiction-aquatic-best-taipei-seafood-fish-market), and feasted on a selection of raw and cooked seafood.

Kelly had her first massage (of many inexpensive and high-quality to come), and we were off to our first night market at [Ningxia](https://danielfooddiary.com/2017/02/16/ningxia/). We ate the usual suspects: stinky tofu, deep fried taro balls with salted egg yolk at Liu Yu Zai (劉芋仔), Fang Chia Shredded Chicken (方家雞肉飯), spring rolls (古早味潤餅), and topped it all off with some sesame peanut mochi shave ice (芝麻花生麻糬冰) and some durian and guava for the walk home. The mochi was a definite highlight, as was the shredded chicken.

The next day, we had some famous Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup at Yongkang. From there, it was a short walk over to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, where we watched the Changing of the Guards. We then made our way over to Taipei 101. Although we were still full from the beef noodle soup, we couldn't help but try some of Hawker Chan's inexpensive Michelin-starred chicken. While tender and flavorful, we thought it didn't measure up to its Singaporean counterpart.

We walked it off with a beautiful hike of Xiangshan, or elephant mountain, with striking views of the Taipei cityscape.

Finally, it was time for another night market at Raohe Street, where we had the Fuzhou Black Pepper Bun (our favorite!), Chen Dong Pork Ribs Medical Herbs Soup, Ma Shu Bao Bao mochi, taro milk, xiaolongbao, and of course some durian for dessert.

While DPS airport is only 15 miles from Ubud, it can take up to an hour and a half to make the drive, due to narrow roads and a mixture of scooter, car, and foot traffic. In terms of foreignness (architecture, culture, religion, ...), we'd put Bali up there with Morocco. Our driver gave us a helpful introduction to the culture. For example, birth order is front and center in their society. He told us to call him [Komang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_name), which means third born. Kelly and I are both Wayan, or the eldest. On our way to Ubud, we stopped by a coffee plantation and tasted six kinds of tea and eight kinds of coffee, including kopi luwak, or civet coffee. It was definitely smoother, but I don't need it to be a daily drinker. We also left with a pack of delicious mangosteen tea.

Our villa in Ubud was amazing, and I think we took full advantage! We had several meals outside by the pool (and cooled off while eating chilled fruit in the pool) and enjoyed the outdoor shower / bathtub (which itself was in a fish pond!).

With it being the summer, the heat and humidity were fairly oppressive. Still, we didn't let it deter us from hikes, although I ended up drenching my hiking shirt in sweat fairly early on. And the frequent breaks for fresh coconuts and refreshing teas made all the difference!

We kept our distance from the monkeys in the Sacred Monkey Forest and just watched them from afar.

The next morning, our driver Yoga took us on a wonderful tour of the island. For $50, or about the price of a taxi to the airport in the U.S., we had a private driver for ten hours. We started with a hike through the Tegallalang Rice Terraces, dodging past a lot of costumed people doing photo shoots.

Yoga drove us north  to Kintamani, with stunning views of Mount Batur and Lake Batur, a volcanic crater lake. We then stopped for one of the most scenic lunches we've had at overlooking the Mahagiri Rice Terraces. We had a private tour of [Besakih Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besakih_Temple), known as the "Mother Temple" due to its size (at least 86 temples, and the largest in Bali).

On the way back to Ubud, we had time to stop by the Tukad Cepung Waterfall before some delicious local cocktails and food.

We had one night in Labuan Bajo on the island of Flores, a common jumping-off point for Komodo National Park. The views did not disappoint, with at least several islands of the archipelago in constant view.
