Pop quiz, which annual Bavarian festival drew over six million visitors, who collectively consumed 2 million gallons of beer? That's right, since we were in the area, we decided to kick off the first day of Oktoberfest in Munich (München), Germany! We started off buying some traditional outfits, a dirndl for Kelly and lederhosen for me. Friends, look forward to seeing us break out this garb around this time every year!

In order to avoid the Day 1 crowds, we had a pre-Oktoberfest meal at the world-famous [Hofbräuhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatliches_Hofbräuhaus_in_München) and enjoyed a delicious pork knuckle and sausage salad. The food (and drink) portions were enormous -- for example, the modal beer size (at HB and the festival) was 1L. The crowds were absolutely crushing, though it was the first day of the festival.

Our next day in Germany, we decided to escape the crowds and take a tour into the Bavarian countryside, visiting Linderhof Palace, the town of Oberammergau, and Neuschwanstein Castle, which is said to have inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland Castle.
