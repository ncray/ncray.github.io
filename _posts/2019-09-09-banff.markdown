We were in [Banff National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banff_National_Park) from 9/6 to 9/9 celebrating Ian and Diana's wedding. It was our first time there, and our impression was that of the Yosemite of Canada, but more developed. There's a charming town of 8000 people at which we stayed (Banff, Alberta) our first two nights, with Emerald Lake rounding out the third.

Here's a short video overview of our trip and the event:
