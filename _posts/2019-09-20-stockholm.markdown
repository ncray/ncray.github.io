Our first stop on our honeymoon was Stockholm, in order to visit Eric (or *Erik*, as he's known here), who is currently participating in a [general relativity research program](http://www.mittag-leffler.se/langa-program/general-relativity-geometry-and-analysis-beyond-first-100-years-after-einstein) at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, after which he'll spend the rest of a year at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Here's a short video overview:

We arrived in the afternoon after a short layover in Iceland, checked in to our Airbnb in the Norrmalm district of Stockholm, and made our way over to the [Vasa Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_Museum), featuring the eponymous ship that sank in the harbor just ~ 1km into its maiden voyage in 1628. A museum about a ship sounds a little bit boring, except maybe if that ship were the Titanic. Well, maybe even if it *were* the Titanic -- but this was very well done. It's pretty impressive to see a huge, 17th century, prestige warship in most of its glory in a big museum, with bits and pieces of the story told through exhibits and short videos.

I don't think there are any other > ~400 year old warships preserved to such a degree. So, why did it (*spoiler alert*) sink almost immediately after such fanfare? This essentially was the result of a confluence of several unlikely events:
* someone with enough power to commission such a large ship to begin with: King Gustav II Adolph
* a spectacularly faulty design, ensuring an almost immediate catastrophe in just-driven-off-the-lot condition: [in this case, the king wanted to one-up his Danish rivals by hurriedly adding a second gun-deck](https://www.simscale.com/blog/2017/12/vasa-ship-sank/)
* poor succession planning in the shipbuilding phase, with perhaps no one to question the King's wishes -- or at least lead to a re-design: the primary designer, Henrik Hybertsson, fell ill and died a year before the ship's completion
* the right underwater conditions for preservation: the brackish water of the Baltic sea meant that shipworm wasn't a worry *and* the massive dumping of sulfur into the water polluted it to such a degree which ironically preserved the ship due to lack of oxygen, inhibiting wood-degrading bacteria
