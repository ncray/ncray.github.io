Morocco was certainly the most different experience from the rest of our trip (so far) in terms of weather, languages, culture, architecture, landscape, and food. We spent three nights in Marrakech, five nights on the road as part of our tour, and a final three nights again in Marrakech. Our flight arrived fairly late ~ midnight. Drones are basically illegal in Morocco, so I had to leave mine at the airport. It was a bit of an ordeal, but I was able to pick it up at the end of the trip, after paying a nominal storage fee.

We spent our first night in a riad (essentially a hotel built around an enclosed garden) in the medina (the old town). Stepping out for a morning stroll, the scene was very chaotic! Scooters, bikes, motorcycles, and donkey-pulled carts zoomed all around us, adding to the general cacophony. It was exhausting (for me at least) to travel more than a few minutes in between all the honking, exhaust fumes, and decaying fish stench from the less-than-sanitary street fishmongers. However, we were never far from a garden or courtyard, which served as mini-oases and much-needed respites from the external chaos.

All together, we drove ~2000km in 5 days, over nearly 30 hours on the road.

Our first day of the tour, we stopped by Marjorelle Gardens (of [Marjorelle Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorelle_Blue) fame), which was restored in the 80's by  Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé. We also visited a Berber (indigeneous group of Northern Africa, with the alien-looking [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh)) museum, the YSL museum, Menara Garden, El Badii Palace, Jemaa el-Fnaa, and Koutoubia Mosque.

I quite enjoyed the [YSL museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_Museum_in_Marrakesh), as it presented an overview of his fashion work and evolution told through exhibits of clothes and an interesting movie. I thought [Jemaa el-Fnaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaa_el-Fnaa) was fairly overrated, even though we returned to it multiple times during the day and night. We must have missed the dancing and story-tellers.

Aït Benhaddou was quite grand. It served as a filming location for Gladiator (the first arena, where Maximus is enslaved in Africa), and we had mint tea in the Berber home where they filmed the scenes where he's in his cell. Aït Benhaddou also served as a filming location for Lawrence of Arabia and Game of Thrones.

Our first night on the road was at Dades Gorge, where we arrived just in time to see the sunset.

We hiked through Todra Gorge, walked through some of the khettaras (ancient subsurface irrigation channels, in which a series of wells placed a few meters apart transport water from an aquifer) and toured a fossil / marble factory. The area was formerly underwater, and a lot of the rocks have high densities of fossils (trilobites, etc...). As a memento, we picked up a soapdish with a fossil in it.

The night in the desert was the highlight of this trip. We checked in to our hotel in Merzouga, then hopped on board our camels for a ~ 1 hr ride. We climbed the steepest dune to wait for the beautiful sunset, then made our to the camps. They run electricity, water, sewage, even internet from the nearby city so we did not lack in creature comforts. In fact, our bed in the tent was probably the softest of our trip! After dinner, we had a roaring fire, dance party, and impromptu drum lessons from our hosts.

We made our way on to Fes, but stopped by a known Barbary macaque monkey sanctuary on the way and fed the monkeys. After enough monkey business, we had a short visit of a tannery, and Kelly picked up a new leather jacket!

We spent a lovely night in Chefchaouen, possibly better known as "the blue city." It's not entirely clear why exactly the city is so blue, and theories range from mosquitos to Jews to making the city more Instagrammable. At any rate, we had a few scenic runs during our short stay.

Heading back south again after Chefchaouen, we stopped by the Roman ruins of Volubilis. After Diocletian's Palace in Split, these were the biggest and most well preserved ruins we had seen, with many partial buildings and mosaics still present. It turns out the same [earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_Lisbon_earthquake) that devastated Lisbon also caused significant damage to Volubilis.

We spent the night in Meknes, then carried on to Rabat the next morning. For those keeping count, this makes all [four imperial cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cities_of_Morocco) (the historical capitals: Fez, Marrakesh, Meknes, and Rabat). We really picked up the pace near the end of our tour and continued on to Casablanca, where we had a lovely lunch with our group at Rick's Cafe. Our final stop on the tour was Hassan II Mosque, which was truly massive. It's one of the largest mosques in the world and one of the few in Morocco that's open to non-Muslims.

After our tour, we had a final couple of nights in Marrakech to decompress, first with some massages and a rough hammam scrub! We also visited Le Jardin Secret and participated in a cooking class, which also had us running around the souks to buy ingredients.
